## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Figma design


### What I learned

On this project I have learned a lots of new and useful tricks. The first of them is using custom properties. It helps me to save a time on properties that repeat a many times. This project has pages that have same parts and and same properties, so it was the best choice to start to using custom properties. The second 
significant thing that I have learned is modern css reset. Everything in one place on the beginning of css file. The next good thing on this project is that I decided to use Figma design. With Figma design is better access to the designs and it is possible extract information about typography, colors, measurement and more.
